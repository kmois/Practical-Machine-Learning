In this assignment we are trying to build a model from 160 variables to 
predict in what manner (A-E) an exercise was done. Unfortunately after 
spending several days to get the caret package installed I did not have
the time to troubleshoot the issues that arose when actually modeling.
So I only submit what little I got:

```{r}
data<-read.csv("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv",
               stringsAsFactors=F, na.strings=c(NA,"NA","#DIV/0!"))
library(caret)
library(randomForest)

data<-data[,8:160]
data$classe <- as.factor(data$classe)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=data$classe,p=0.75,list=FALSE)
training<-data[inTrain,]
testing<-data[-inTrain,]
## model <- randomForest(classe~.,data=training,ntree=100,na.action=na.roughfix)
```

Although classe is a factor variable I get an error that na.roughfix only
works for factor variables - which classe is, and class does not even
have any NA-s. So that's where I got stuck and if you know how to get around
this please leave some hints as comments!
